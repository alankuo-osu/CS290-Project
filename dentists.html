    General dentists are somewhat similar to a primary care provider in medicine. They are the dentist that you probably see the most (eg. for your cleaning/checkup appointments). General dentists are also qualified to perform <strong>all basic procedures</strong> (such as fillings, crowns, pulling teeth, whitening, etc.), and some also offer more advanced services like Invisalign and wisdom tooth extractions. Their fees may be lower for certain procedures compared to a specialist. In more difficult cases that are out of their expertise, they can refer to a specialist.

  <div id="cosmeticDentist" class="dentistContent">
    Cosmetic dentists are general dentists that specialize in procedures to <strong>improve the appearance of your teeth and smile</strong>. These are procedures like veneers, whitening, and composite fillings. Cosmetic dentistry is not an officialy recognized specialty, and any general dentist can advertise that they are a cosmetic dentist. However, there are certifications and extra training that cosmetic dentists may have, such as being a member of the American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry, that show their dedication to cosmetic dentistry.
