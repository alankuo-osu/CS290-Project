  <div id="generalDentist" class="dentistContent">
    General dentists are somewhat similar to a primary care provider in medicine. They are the dentist that you probably see the most (eg. for your cleaning/checkup appointments). General dentists are also qualified to perform <strong>all basic procedures</strong> (such as fillings, crowns, pulling teeth, whitening, etc.), and some also offer more advanced services like Invisalign and wisdom tooth extractions. Their fees may be lower for certain procedures compared to a specialist. In more difficult cases that are out of their expertise, they can refer to a specialist.

  <div id="cosmeticDentist" class="dentistContent">
    Cosmetic dentists are general dentists that specialize in procedures to <strong>improve the appearance of your teeth and smile</strong>. These are procedures like veneers, whitening, and composite fillings. Cosmetic dentistry is not an officialy recognized specialty, and any general dentist can advertise that they are a cosmetic dentist. However, there are certifications and extra training that cosmetic dentists may have, such as being a member of the American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry, that show their dedication to cosmetic dentistry.

  <div class="dentistHeader" onclick="rotate('endoTriangle', 'endodontist')"><span id="endoTriangle" class="triangle" >►</span><span>Endodontist</span></div>
  <div id="endodontist" class="dentistContent">
    Endodontists are <strong>root canal</strong> specialists. They typically only perform procedures related to the nerves of the teeth, including root canals and some other surgical procedures. Patients typically see endodontists when a tooth's nerve is damaged or dying (usually either from an infection or from trauma). Contrary to popular belief, root canals typically are not very painful. You will first be numbed and asked to open wide. The endodontist will then place a protective barrier called a <strong>rubber dam</strong> around the tooth. The rubber dam is designed to prevent bacteria and saliva from the rest of your mouth from contaminating the root canal. For the root canal itself, the endodontist will clean out the remaining nerve from your tooth (patients may experience a grinding or vibrating sensation), and then fill up the space where the nerve was with a special filler material.

  <div class="dentistHeader" onclick="rotate('pathTriangle', 'oralPathologist')"><span id="pathTriangle" class="triangle" >►</span><span>Oral Pathologist</span></div>
  <div id="oralPathologist" class="dentistContent">
    Oral pathologists are specialists in <strong>diagnosing diseases affecting the mouth and jaws</strong>. Oral pathologists will typically perform diagnostic procedures such as soft tissue biopsies or X-rays/CT scans/MRIs. Patients are usually referred to oral pathologists by other dentists when any unusual findings are noticed. If you feel that something in your mouth has changed, such as a new bump on your gums or a change in color, make sure that you mention it to your dentist to see if it might be something that needs further investigation.
