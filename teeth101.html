      <h2>What's in a tooth?</h2>
      <p>
        Like onions and ogres, teeth are made of many different layers. The outermost layer is called the <strong>enamel</strong>. This is the pearly white layer that we see when we look at teeth. Enamel is the hardest substance in the human body, but it can be weakened by acids (such as soda and sour candies) and bacteria. The next layer is called the <strong>dentin</strong>. The dentin provides support to the enamel, but is less hard and less resistant to acid and bacteria. The innermost layer is called the <strong>pulp</strong>. The pulp is the "living" portion of the tooth, and contains nerves, blood vessels, and cells that help repair the dentin.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of overall structure, a tooth is made up of two parts - the <strong>crown</strong> and the <strong>root</strong>. The crown is the part of the tooth that we see above the gums, and the root is the part underneath the gums that helps anchor the tooth into the jawbone.

      <h2>So, what is a cavity?</h2>
      <p>
        A cavity is an area of your tooth that has been damaged by bacteria in your mouth, in combination with other factors such as sugary and acidic drinks/foods and poor hygiene. What basically happens is the bacteria feed on the food and sugars that you eat, producing an acid. This acid then starts to weaken and break down the enamel of your tooth, eventually leading to an area of physical damage. When the area of damage is small, we often don't feel any pain or sensitivity. It is only when the damage progresses into the dentin and close to the pulp that we start feeling pain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Very small areas of breakdown can often be stopped or reversed by improving brushing/flossing and using fluoride rinses. However, if the area of breakdown gets bigger, it will won't get better on its own and will likely get worse. That's why it is so important to go see the dentist regularly for exams and X-rays to make sure that no new cavities are developing.

      Some other problems that can occur are fractured teeth and loose teeth.
      <p>
        Fractured teeth can occur due to several reasons, such as trauma from falling, getting hit, or biting down on something hard. Depending on how much of the tooth breaks off, the fracture may be repairable with a filling. If a significant part of the tooth has broken off, however, the tooth may require a crown to repair or may even need to be taken out. If your tooth becomes fractured, try to get to the dentist as soon as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases of trauma, teeth can be knocked loose or even come out. If your tooth gets knocked out, pick it up by the crown (not the root), rinse the tooth briefly in water to clean it off, and try to place it back in. If you cannot place the tooth back in, make sure to keep the tooth in milk or inside your cheek. Do NOT place the tooth in tap water, as this will lead to damage to the root. See a dentist within 30 minutes of the tooth being knocked out. If you are unable to see a dentist within 30 minutes, it still may be possible to save the tooth but it is much less likely. If your tooth is loose, try your best to move it back to where it originally was, and see a dentist right away. The dentist may need to place a temporary splint (a wire that is attached to your tooth to keep it in place) until it heals.

        Fillings are some of the most common dental treatments. The filling procedure involves removing any decayed or weakened portions of the tooth (the cavity), and replacing the missing part. Fillings are done with two main materials: <strong>composite</strong> and <strong>amalgam</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Composite fillings (or white colored fillings) are the more popular option today. They are much more aesthetic since they match the color of your natural tooth. However, they are more difficult to place, requiring the area to be completely dry and not be contaminated with saliva. If you do not maintain good oral hygiene, composite fillings can also be more prone to developing cavities between the tooth and the filling. The basic process of placing a composite filling involves several steps - numbing the tooth, cleaning out the cavity, rinsing and pre-treating the tooth, placing the filling in, hardening the filling with a special light, and polishing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Amalgam fillings (or silver colored fillings) were the primary type of filling in the past but have become less popular today. Since they are silver colored, they are much less aesthetic than composite fillings. However, they are easier to place compared with composite fillings, and some studies have shown that amalgam fillings tend to last longer than composite fillings. The basic process of placing an amalgam filling involves: numbing the tooth, cleaning out the cavity, mixing the amalgam material, placing the amalgam on the tooth, and shaping the amalgam. Another possible concern with amalgam fillings is the mercury content in the amalgam material, but the American Dental Association states that amalgam fillings remain a safe option, and that having amalgam fillings does not result in any adverse health effects.

        Crowns are a preferred method of treatment for teeth that cannot be treated with a normal filling. For example, if a tooth has a very large cavity, the filling would need to be very large and would be weak and prone to breaking. A crown is an all-surface covering for a tooth that is made of porcelain, metal, or a combination of the two, and is much stronger than a filling. Treatment for a crown involves several steps: Numbing the tooth, removal of the outside of the tooth so that the crown has enough space to fit over it, making a mold of the tooth so that the dental laboratory can make the crown, placement of a temporary crown on your tooth while the dental laboratory makes the crown, and then placement of the final crown. Some offices with the latest technology can even create the crown in the office while you wait!

        Tooth extractions (or taking out teeth) are done for a variety of reasons. In cases of teeth with very large cavities, it may not be possible to save the tooth with a filling or crown and the tooth may need to be extracted. Wisdom teeth are also commonly extracted in teenagers and young adults. If a tooth is infected (eg. from the cavity reaching the pulp), it may need to be extracted as well. The extraction process involves several steps: numbing the tooth that needs to be taken out, loosening the tooth with special tools, and finally removing the tooth. The loosening process may involve sensations of strong pressure or pushing for the patient.

        For patients with misaligned or crowded teeth, braces are a common treatment. What braces essentially do is move teeth in a slow and controlled manner until they are aligned. Traditional metal braces involve attaching metal brackets to your teeth and connecting these brackets with a wire. The wires are adjusted over time to move teeth in the correct directions. Clear retainers are a more recently available option that is much less noticeable than metal braces. However, not every cases can be successfully treated with clear retainers. If you are interested in straightening or aligning your teeth, you should start with a consultation with a local orthodontist.
